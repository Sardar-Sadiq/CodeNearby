This omission limits users‚Äô ability to quickly navigate to the project‚Äôs official social media pages, reducing opportunities for community engagement and brand visibility. Adding a dedicated social media section will enhance connectivity and professionalism.\n\nBenefits\n-Improves user navigation and experience.\n-Provides quick access to official social media profiles.\n-Enhances brand visibility and engagement.\n\nSuggested Implementation\n-Add correct href URLs for each social media icon.\n-Use target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to open links in a new tab securely.\n-Verify that all icons have valid links to the respective platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram).\n\nContribution\nI would like to work on implementing functional and verified social media links in the footer.Please assign this issue to me.\n\nThank You",

Recommended logic:\n\n* üß± Ensure icons and text do **not overlap** by using responsive utility classes like `flex-wrap`, `gap-x-2`, or `text-sm`.\n* üìè Stack buttons vertically or wrap them inside a flex column when screen width is below a certain breakpoint (e.g., `sm:` or `md:`).\n* üîß Consider hiding the button text on smaller devices and showing only the icons with tooltips for cleaner UI.\n\nThis will make the buttons more usable and visually clean on all devices.\n\n---\n\n### üëÄ What‚Äôs wrong with the current version?\n\nCurrently, on smaller screen sizes, the icon and text inside each button overlap, causing a cramped and unreadable layout.
