# API Terms of Use

By using the CodeNearby API, you agree to the following:

## Authentication
- All requests must include a valid API key in the `x-api-key` header.

## Usage and Limits
- Token-based metering applies to each call.
- Daily free tokens reset automatically; paid tokens are consumed until depleted.
- Abuse, scraping at scale, or attempts to bypass metering are prohibited.

## Data and Compliance
- Respect third-party platform terms (e.g., GitHub).
- Do not store or expose personal data in violation of applicable laws.

## Availability
- The API is provided as-is; uptime and quotas may change.

## Revocation
- We may revoke keys that violate these terms without notice.

See `docs/API_GUIDE.md` and `API_ROUTES_SUMMARY.md` for technical details.
